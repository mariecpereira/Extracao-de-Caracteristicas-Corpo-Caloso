## 1 - What is this repository for? 

This repository is part of the IA369Z project course from School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (FEEC) at the University of Campinas. The algorithms contained here are part of the study of the paper "Corpus callosum diffusion properties differences in systemic lupus patients" and describe the ROQS segmentation method, the Witelson and Hofer and Frahm's parcellation methods. As well as the statistical analysis of the diffusion properties of the subjects. 

## 2 - How do I get set up?
